# Altair Manual Part I Notes

## Logic

* All practical digital computers are based on the logic concepts explained
  by George Boole in his 1847 booklet, [The Mathematical Analysis of
  Logic](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/36884).
* [Boolean algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_algebra), the logic
  system created by Boole, uses a two-valued logic, where each statement can
  either be true or false.
* This two-valued system lends itself to automation by digital devices, where
  the two physical states of **on** and **off** can be used represent the
  values true and false.


## Binary, Octal, and Hexadecimal Numbers

The manual introduces the binary number system, and describes how octal can
be used for notational convenience. It doesn't mention hexadecimal numbers,
but I know from looking at the on-line Altair 8800
